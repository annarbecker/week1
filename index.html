          As a Portland native, I grew up in the city and after high school graduation was ready for a change of scenery. In fall 2008, I found myself in Gambier, Ohio as a freshman at Kenyon College. During my time at Kenyon I recieved a BA in Sociology with a minor in French.

          After graduation, and four years of miserable Ohio winters, I moved back to Portland. As a recent grad I was unsure of exactly what I wanted to do. I began volunteering at a local nonprofit located in the St. Johns neighborhood, Portland After-School Tennis &amp; Educaiton (PAST&amp;E). After my first day of volunteering I was extremely impressed with the organization's mission, impact, and staff. I continued to volunteer  throughout the summer of 2012 and in late August of that year the Executive Director offered me a job.
          <br></br>
          I worked at PAST&amp;E for three and a half years. In my time with the organization I was a Caoch/Tutor and provided one-on-one tutoring and tennis instruciton to elementary through high school aged children. In the second year of my employment I took over as  Manager of St. Johns Racquet Center, the facility in which the orangization is located, and oversaw  day-to-day operations for public use of the facility's courts. Most recently, I worked as the Development Director writing grants, cultivating donors, and organizing major fundraisers.
          <br></br>
          Throughout my schooling and employement I always enjoyed the design and creative elements of my work the most. During my time at PAST&amp;E I had the opportunity to create promotional materials in Adobe Illustrator and redesign the website using Squarespace. As I started to look into what I wanted to do next in my career path I knew that I wanted it to include design and technology.
          <br></br>
          Right around this time I was hearing more and more about code bootcamps. I was interested in learning more about the schools and speaking with a graduate. I reached out to a former colleague of mine, Maureen ("Moe") Dugan. When I joined the PAST&amp;E team Moe was the Development Director and I worked closely with her before she left the organizaiton in winter 2013. I sat down with Moe and flooded her with questions about her experience with coding and as a student at Epicodus. Moe was very encouraging in my exploration of the field. After our meeting I decided I knew what I wanted to do next and submitted my Epicodus application.
